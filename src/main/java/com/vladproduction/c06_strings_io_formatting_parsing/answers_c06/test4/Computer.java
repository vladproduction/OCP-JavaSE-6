    A. exc

    //A

    /*Answer:
            âœ“ A is correct. An instance of type Computer Has-a Keyboard. Because Keyboard doesn't
    implement Serializable, any attempt to serialize an instance of Computer will cause an
    exception to be thrown.
             B, C, D, and E are incorrect based on the above. If Keyboard did implement Serializable
    then two objects would have been serialized. (Objective 3.3)*/
