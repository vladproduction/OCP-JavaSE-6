        /*Answer:
                âœ“ C and F are correct. C is correct because static and transient variables are not
        serialized when an object is serialized. F is a valid statement.
          A, B, D, and E are incorrect based on the above. G is incorrect because you
        don't implement the defaultReadObject() method, you call it from within the
        readObject()method, along with any custom read operations your class needs.
                (Objective 3.3)*/
