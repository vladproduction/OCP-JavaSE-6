    /*Answer:
            âœ“ C is correct. It's okay for a class to implement Serializable even if its superclass doesn't.
            However, when you deserialize such an object, the non-serializable superclass must run its
    constructor. Remember, constructors don't run on deserialized classes that implement
    Serializable.
  A, B, D, E, and F are incorrect based on the above. (Objective 3.3)*/
