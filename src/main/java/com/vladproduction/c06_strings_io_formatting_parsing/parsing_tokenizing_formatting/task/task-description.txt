description:
Write code that uses standard J2SE APIs in the java.util and java.util.regex packages to
format or parse strings or streams. For strings, write code that uses the Pattern and Matcher
classes and the String.split method. Recognize and use regular expression patterns for matching
(limited to: .(dot), *(star), +(plus), ?, \d, \s, \w, [ ], () ). The use of *, + , and ? will
be limited to greedy quantifiers, and the parenthesis operator will only be used as a grouping
mechanism, not for capturing content during matching. For streams, write code using the
Formatter and Scanner classes and the PrintWriter.format/printf methods. Recognize and use
formatting parameters (limited to: %b, %c, %d, %f, %s) in format strings.

covered:
1)Using the Pattern and Matcher classes for string manipulation.
2)Using String.split method.
3)Using regular expression patterns.
4)Using the Formatter and Scanner classes.
5)Using PrintWriter for formatted output.

Explanation of the Code
-Scanner Class: We use Scanner to read a line of input from the user.
-Pattern and Matcher Classes:
We compile a regular expression pattern that matches words containing digits.
We then use the Matcher to find all occurrences of this pattern in the input string and print them.
-String.split Method: We use inputString.split("\\s+") to split the input string into words based on whitespace.
-Formatter and PrintWriter:
We create a PrintWriter to write formatted output to a file named output.txt.
A Formatter is used to format the number of words and their lengths into the output file.
-Regular Expressions: The regex pattern \\w+\\d+\\w* matches any word containing at least one digit.

Compile and Run the Program
Save your Java code.
Compile it using javac RegexAndFormattingDemo.java.
Run the program using java RegexAndFormattingDemo, and then enter a sentence when prompted.

Check the Output
After running the program, check the console output for words with digits and those split by spaces.
Check the output.txt file for formatted output showing the total number of words and their respective lengths.
