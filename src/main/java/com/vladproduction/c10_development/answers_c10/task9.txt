 9. Given the following directory structure:
x-|
  |- FindBaz.class
  |
  |- test-|
          |- Baz.class
          |
          |- myApp-|
                   |- Baz.class
 And given the contents of the related .java files:
 1. public class FindBaz {
 2. public static void main(String[] args) { new Baz(); }
 3. }
 In the test directory:
 1. public class Baz {
 2. static { System.out.println("test/Baz"); }
 3. }
 In the myApp directory:
  1. public class Baz {
  2. static { System.out.println("myApp/Baz"); }
  3. }
  If the current directory is x, which invocations will produce the output "test/Baz"? (Choose
 all that apply.)
  A. java FindBaz
  B. java -classpath test FindBaz
  C. java -classpath .:test FindBaz
  D. java -classpath .:test/myApp FindBaz
  E. java -classpath test:test/myApp FindBaz
  F. java -classpath test:test/myApp:. FindBaz
  G. java -classpath test/myApp:test:. FindBaz
 Answer:
   âœ“ C and F are correct. The java command must find both FindBaz and the version of
 Baz located in the test directory. The "." finds FindBaz, and "test" must come before
 "test/myApp" or java will find the other version of Baz. Remember the real exam will
 default to using the Unix path separator.
   A, B, D, E, and G are incorrect based on the above. (Objective 7.2)
