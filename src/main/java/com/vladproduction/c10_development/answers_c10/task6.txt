6. Given two files:
 1. package pkgA;
 2. public class Foo {
 3. int a = 5;
 4. protected int b = 6;
 5. }
 1. package pkgB;
 2. import pkgA.*;
 3. public class Fiz extends Foo {
 4. public static void main(String[] args) {
 5. Foo f = new Foo();
 6. System.out.print(" " + f.a);
 7. System.out.print(" " + f.b);
 8. System.out.print(" " + new Fiz().a);
 9. System.out.println(" " + new Fiz().b);
10. }
11. }
 What is the result? (Choose all that apply.)
 A. 5 6 5 6
 B. 5 6 followed by an exception
 C. Compilation fails with an error on line 6
 D. Compilation fails with an error on line 7
 E. Compilation fails with an error on line 8
 F. Compilation fails with an error on line 9
Answer:
  âœ“ C, D, and E are correct. Variable a (default access) cannot be accessed from outside the
package. Since variable b is protected, it can be accessed only through inheritance.
  A, B, and F are incorrect based on the above. (Objectives 1.1, 7.1)
