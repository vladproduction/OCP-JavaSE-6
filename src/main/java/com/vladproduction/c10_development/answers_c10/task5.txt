5. If three versions of MyClass.class exist on a file system:
Version 1 is in /foo/bar
Version 2 is in /foo/bar/baz
Version 3 is in /foo/bar/baz/bing
 And the system's classpath includes
/foo/bar/baz
 And this command line is invoked from /foo
java -classpath /foo/bar/baz/bing:/foo/bar MyClass
 Which version will be used by java?
 A. /foo/MyClass.class
 B. /foo/bar/MyClass.class
 C. /foo/bar/baz/MyClass.class
 D. /foo/bar/baz/bing/MyClass.class
 E. The result is not predictable.
Answer:
  D is correct. A -classpath included with a java invocation overrides a system classpath.
When java is using any classpath, it reads the classpath from left to right, and uses the
first match it finds.
  A, B, C, and E are incorrect based on the above. (Objective 7.5)
