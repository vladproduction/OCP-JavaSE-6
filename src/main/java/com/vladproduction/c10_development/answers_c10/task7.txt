7. Given:
 3. import java.util.*;
 4. public class Antique {
 5. public static void main(String[] args) {
 6. List<String> myList = new ArrayList<String>();
 7. assert (args.length > 0);
  8. System.out.println("still static");
  9. }
 10. }
  Which sets of commands (javac followed by java) will compile and run without exception or
 error? (Choose all that apply.)
  A. javac Antique.java
 java Antique
  B. javac Antique.java
 java -ea Antique
  C. javac -source 6 Antique.java
 java Antique
  D. javac -source 1.4 Antique.java
 java Antique
  E. javac -source 1.6 Antique.java
 java -ea Antique
 Answer:
   âœ“ A and C are correct. If assertions (which were first available in Java 1.4) are enabled, an
 AssertionError will be thrown at line 7.
   D is incorrect because the code uses generics, and generics weren't introduced until Java 5.
 B and E are incorrect based on the above. (Objective 7.2)
