10. Given the following directory structure:
test-|
     |- Test.java
     |
     |- myApp-|
              |- Foo.java
              |
              |- myAppSub-|
                          |- Bar.java
 If the current directory is test, and you create a .jar file by invoking this,
jar -cf MyJar.jar myApp
then which path names will find a file in the .jar file? (Choose all that apply.)
 A. Foo.java
 B. Test.java
 C. myApp/Foo.java
 D. myApp/Bar.java
 E. META-INF/Foo.java
 F. META-INF/myApp/Foo.java
 G. myApp/myAppSub/Bar.java
Answer:
  ✓ C and G are correct. The files in a .jar file will exist within the same exact directory tree
structure in which they existed when the .jar was created. Although a .jar file will contain
a META-INF directory, none of your files will be in it. Finally, if any files exist in the
directory from which the jar command was invoked, they won’t be included in the
.jar file by default.
  A, B, D, E, and F are incorrect based on the above. (Objective 7.5)
