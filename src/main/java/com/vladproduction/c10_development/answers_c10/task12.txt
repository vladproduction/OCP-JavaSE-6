12. Given the following directory structure:
x-|
  |- GoDeep.class
  |
  |- test-|
          |- MyJar.jar
          |
          |- myApp-|
                   |-Foo.java
                   |-Foo.class
 And given the contents of GoDeep.java and Foo.java:
 3. public class GoDeep {
 4. public static void main(String[] args) {
 5. System.out.println(myApp.Foo.d);
 6. }
 7. }
 3. package myApp;
 4. public class Foo { public static int d = 8; }
 And MyJar.jar contains the following entry:
 myApp/Foo.class
  If the current directory is x, which commands will successfully execute GoDeep.class and
 produce the output 8? (Choose all that apply.)
  A. java GoDeep
  B. java -classpath . GoDeep
  C. java -classpath test/MyJar.jar GoDeep
  D. java GoDeep -classpath test/MyJar.jar
  E. java GoDeep -classpath test/MyJar.jar:.
  F. java -classpath .:test/MyJar.jar GoDeep
  G. java -classpath test/MyJar.jar:. GoDeep
 Answer:
   âœ“ F and G are correct. The java command must find both GoDeep and Foo, and the
 -classpath option must come before the class name. Note, the current directory
 (.), in the classpath can be searched first or last.
   A, B, C, D, and E are incorrect based on the above. (Objective 7.5)
