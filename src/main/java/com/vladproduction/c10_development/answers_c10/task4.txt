4. Given two files:
a=b.java
c_d.class
 Are in the current directory, which command-line invocation(s) could complete without error?
(Choose all that apply.)
 A. java -Da=b c_d
 B. java -D a=b c_d
 C. javac -Da=b c_d
 D. javac -D a=b c_d

 Answer:
   âœ“ A is correct. The -D flag is NOT a compiler flag, and the name=value pair that is
 associated with the -D must follow the -D with no spaces.
   B, C, and D are incorrect based on the above. (Objective 7.2)
