11. Given the following directory structure:
test-|
     |- GetJar.java
     |
     |- myApp-|
              |-Foo.java
 And given the contents of GetJar.java and Foo.java:
 3. public class GetJar {
 4. public static void main(String[] args) {
 5. System.out.println(myApp.Foo.d);
 6. }
 7. }
 3. package myApp;
 4. public class Foo { public static int d = 8; }
 If the current directory is "test", and myApp/Foo.class is placed in a JAR file called MyJar.jar
 located in test, which set(s) of commands will compile GetJar.java and produce the output 8?
 (Choose all that apply.)
  A. javac -classpath MyJar.jar GetJar.java
 java GetJar
  B. javac MyJar.jar GetJar.java
 java GetJar
  C. javac -classpath MyJar.jar GetJar.java
 java -classpath MyJar.jar GetJar
  D. javac MyJar.jar GetJar.java
 java -classpath MyJar.jar GetJar
 Answer:
   âœ“ A is correct. Given the current directory and where the necessary files are located, these
 are the correct command line statements.
   B and D are wrong because javac MyJar.jar GetJar.java is incorrect syntax. C is wrong
 because the -classpath MyJar.java in the java invocation does not include the test directory.
