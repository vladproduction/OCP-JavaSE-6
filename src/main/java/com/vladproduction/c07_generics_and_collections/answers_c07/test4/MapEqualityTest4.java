//==>commented hasCode give us hashCode for Object, (but uncommented '9' value for all elements in a map),
// '==' compare memory address but not context,
// as long as we have created different objects (and they are different because hashCode different)

//==>uncommented our hashCode give 9 all the time, so after that at the bucket we have 3 elements;
//and we have to check them by our 'not good overridden' equals() where we compare the memory location, but for Strings we have String pool
//where two String are equal if they have same context; for t1 and t2 it`s true so in the map (where keys are unique) will be added only one Monday (t2),
// the first one (t1) will be rewritten
/*      output:
        t1.hashCode() = 9
        t2.hashCode() = 9
        t3.hashCode() = 9

/*Answer:
        âœ“ C and D are correct. If hashCode() is not overridden then every entry will go into its own
bucket, and the overridden equals() method will have no effect on determining equivalency.
If hashCode() is overridden, then the overridden equals() method will view t1 and
t2 as duplicates.
  A, B, E, and F are incorrect based on the above. (Objective 6.2)*/
