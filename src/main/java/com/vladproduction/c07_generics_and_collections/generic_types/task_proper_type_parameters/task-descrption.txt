Develop code that makes proper use of type parameters in class/interface declarations,
instance variables, method arguments, and return types; and write generic methods or
methods that make use of wildcard types and understand the similarities and differences
between these two approaches. Write code that uses the NavigableSet and NavigableMap
interfaces.

Solution description:
* Using type parameters in generics for class and interface declarations,
as well as method arguments and return types;
* We'll also explore generic methods and wildcard types;
* Finally, weâ€™ll look at how to use the NavigableSet and NavigableMap interfaces in Java;

Wildcards in Generics
Wildcards (denoted by ?) are used in situations where you want to specify a flexible type.
There are three types of wildcards: unbounded, bounded upper, and bounded lower.
