HashMap Behavior:

A HashMap uses both the hashCode and equals methods to store and retrieve keys.
When you put an object into the map, it calculates the hash code and uses that to determine where to store the object in the underlying array.
When you retrieve an object using get(),
it again calculates the hash code and looks in the specific bucket where the key should be,
then it checks each object in that bucket for equality using the equals() method.

default hashCode() method from Object, which usually returns a unique identifier based on the object's memory address.
