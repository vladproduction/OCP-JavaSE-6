When designing a Java application, choosing the right collection classes and interfaces is crucial for ensuring efficient data management and retrieval.
Below is a design scenario and a detailed implementation using different collection classes and the Comparable interface.

Design Scenario:
Let's consider a simple application where we need to manage a list of books in a library. Each book has the following attributes:
*title (String)
*author (String)
*publicationYear (int)

We want to:
*Store the books in a collection.
*Allow sorting of books based on their publication year.
*Provide functionality to find a book by its title.
*Prevent duplicates (two books with the same title and author).

Choice of Collection Classes:
*List: To store and maintain the order of books, we'll use ArrayList.
*Set: To prevent duplicates based on a unique combination of title and author, we'll use HashSet in conjunction with a custom
implementation of equals() and hashCode().
*Sorting: To enable sorting of books by publication year, we will implement the Comparable interface.
