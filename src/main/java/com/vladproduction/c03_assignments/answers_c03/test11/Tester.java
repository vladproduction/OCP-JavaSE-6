        /*Answer:
            B is correct. It should be clear that there is still a reference to the object referred to by
            a2, and that there is still a reference to the object referred to by a2.b2. What might be
            less clear is that you can still access the other Beta object through the static variable
            a2.b1â€”because it's static.*/
