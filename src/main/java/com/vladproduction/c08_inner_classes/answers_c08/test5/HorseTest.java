/*What is the result?
A. An exception occurs at runtime at line 10
B. Zippo
C. Compilation fails because of an error on line 3
D. Compilation fails because of an error on line 9
+E. Compilation fails because of an error on line 10*/

/*Answer:
        âœ“ E. If you use a reference variable of type Object, you can access only those members
defined in class Object.
         A, B, C, and D are incorrect based on the program logic described above*/
