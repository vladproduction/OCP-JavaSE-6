/*What is the result?
A. 15
+B. 21
C. An exception is thrown at runtime
D. Compilation fails due to multiple errors
E. Compilation fails due only to an error on line 4
F. Compilation fails due only to an error on line 5*/

/*Answer:
        âœ“ B is correct. The inner class Gazer has access to Navel's private static and private
instance variables.
         A, C, D, E, and F are incorrect based on the above. (Objectives 1.1, 1.4)*/
