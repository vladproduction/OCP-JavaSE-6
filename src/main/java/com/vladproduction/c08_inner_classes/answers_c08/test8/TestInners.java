/*What is the result?
A. inner
B. outer
+C. middle
D. Compilation fails
E. An exception is thrown at runtime*/

/*Answer:
        âœ“ C is correct. The "inner" version of class A isn't used because its declaration comes
after the instance of class A is created in the go() method.
  A, B, D, and E are incorrect based on the above. (Objective 1.1)*/
