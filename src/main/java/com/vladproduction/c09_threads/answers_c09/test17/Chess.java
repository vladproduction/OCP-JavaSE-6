/*When either fragment I or fragment II is inserted at line 7, which are true? (Choose all that apply.)
-A. Compilation fails
-B. With fragment I, an exception is thrown
+C. With fragment I, the output could be 4 2 4 2
-D. With fragment I, the output could be 4 4 2 3
+E. With fragment II, the output could be 2 4 2 4*/

/*Answer:
        âœ“ C and E are correct. E should be obvious. C is correct because even though move() is
synchronized, it's being invoked on two different objects.
         A, B, and D are incorrect based on the above. (Objective 4.3)*/
