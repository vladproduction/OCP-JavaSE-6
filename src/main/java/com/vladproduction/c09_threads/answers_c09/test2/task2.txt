2. Given:
 3. class MyThread extends Thread {
 4. public static void main(String [] args) {
 5. MyThread t = new MyThread();
 6. Thread x = new Thread(t);
 7. x.start();
 8. }
 9. public void run() {
10. for(int i=0;i<3;++i) {
11. System.out.print(i + "..");
12. }
13. }
14. }
 What is the result of this code?
 A. Compilation fails
 B. 1..2..3..
 C. 0..1..2..3..
 +D. 0..1..2..
 E. An exception occurs at runtime

 Answer:
   âœ“ D is correct. The thread MyThread will start and loop three times (from 0 to 2).
   A is incorrect because the Thread class implements the Runnable interface; therefore,
 in line 5, Thread can take an object of type Thread as an argument in the constructor
 (this is NOT recommended). B and C are incorrect because the variable i in the for
 loop starts with a value of 0 and ends with a value of 2. E is incorrect based on the above.
