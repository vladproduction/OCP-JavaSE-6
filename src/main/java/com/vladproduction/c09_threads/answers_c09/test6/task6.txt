6. Assume the following method is properly synchronized and called from a thread A on an object B:
wait(2000);
 After calling this method, when will the thread A become a candidate to get another turn at
the CPU?
 +A. After object B is notified, or after two seconds
 B. After the lock on B is released, or after two seconds
 C. Two seconds after object B is notified
 D. Two seconds after lock B is released

 Answer:
   âœ“ A is correct. Either of the two events will make the thread a candidate for running again.
   B is incorrect because a waiting thread will not return to runnable when the lock is
 released, unless a notification occurs. C is incorrect because the thread will become a
 candidate immediately after notification. D is also incorrect because a thread will not come
 out of a waiting pool just because a lock has been released. (Objective 4.4)
