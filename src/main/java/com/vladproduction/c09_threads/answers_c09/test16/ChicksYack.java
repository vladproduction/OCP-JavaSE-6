/*Which are true? (Choose all that apply.)
A. Compilation fails
B. The output could be 4 4 2 3
C. The output could be 4 4 2 2
D. The output could be 4 4 4 2
E. The output could be 2 2 4 4
+F. An exception is thrown at runtime --> NullPointerException
*/

/*Answer:
        âœ“ F is correct. When run() is invoked, it is with a new instance of ChicksYack and c has
not been assigned to an object. If c were static, then because yack is synchronized, answers
C and E would have been correct.
  A, B, C, D, and E are incorrect based on the above. (Objective 4.3)*/
