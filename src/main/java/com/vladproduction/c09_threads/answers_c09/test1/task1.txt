1. The following block of code creates a Thread using a Runnable target:
Runnable target = new MyRunnable();
Thread myThread = new Thread(target);
 Which of the following classes can be used to create the target, so that the preceding code
compiles correctly?
 A. public class MyRunnable extends Runnable{public void run(){}}
 B. public class MyRunnable extends Object{public void run(){}}
 +C. public class MyRunnable implements Runnable{public void run(){}}
 D. public class MyRunnable implements Runnable{void run(){}}
 E. public class MyRunnable implements Runnable{public void start(){}}

 Answer:
   âœ“ C is correct. The class implements the Runnable interface with a legal run() method.
   A is incorrect because interfaces are implemented, not extended. B is incorrect because
 even though the class has a valid public void run() method, it does not implement
 the Runnable interface. D is incorrect because the run() method must be public. E is
 incorrect because the method to implement is run(), not start(). (Objective 4.1)
