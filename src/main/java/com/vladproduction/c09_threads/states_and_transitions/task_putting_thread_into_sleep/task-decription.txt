Creating a Thread and Putting It to Sleep
In this exercise we will create a simple counting thread. It will count to 100, pausing
one second between each number. Also, in keeping with the counting theme, it will
output a string every ten numbers.
Steps:
1. Create a class and extend the Thread class. As an option, you can implement
 the Runnable interface.
2. Override the run() method of Thread. This is where the code will go that will
 output the numbers.
3. Create a for loop that will loop 100 times. Use the modulo operation to
 check whether there are any remainder numbers when divided by 10.
4. Use the static method Thread.sleep() to pause. (Remember, the one-arg
version of sleep() specifies the amount of time of sleep in milliseconds.)
