//explanation of interrupt() method (in context of run() from Calculator):
/*
1)Handling InterruptedException:
When a thread is waiting (in this case, during wait() or sleep()), and it gets interrupted, it will throw an InterruptedException.
This is a signal that the thread was asked to stop what it was doing.
2)Clearing the Interrupted Status:
When the InterruptedException is thrown, Java clears the interrupt status of the thread. This is critical because
if your thread later checks whether it has been interrupted (e.g., by using Thread.interrupted() or isInterrupted()),
it will return false instead of true after the exception has been thrown unless you reset it manually (by call interrupt()).
This is why you're calling Thread.currentThread().interrupt(); in the catch blockâ€”to restore the interrupted status so that the thread can remain
aware of its interrupted state after handling the exception.
*/
//Conclusion:
/*Handle the InterruptedException by restoring the interrupted status
because it is cleared when this exception is thrown.
It ensures that if other parts of the code check the interrupt status,
they get the correct information, allowing for appropriate handling of thread interruptions.*/
