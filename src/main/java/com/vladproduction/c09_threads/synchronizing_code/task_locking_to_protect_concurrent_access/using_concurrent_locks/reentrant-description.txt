In the context of using ReentrantLock to manage shared resources in a multithreading environment,
ensuring transaction consistency and atomicity is paramount.
Hereâ€™s a detailed conclusion on these concepts:

Atomicity:
Atomicity ensures that a series of operations either all happen or none happen. In our case, when performing a deposit or withdrawal,
these operations must be treated as a single, indivisible action.
By using ReentrantLock, we ensure that when a thread is executing a deposit or withdrawal operation, no other thread can interfere
until the operation is complete. This prevents race conditions where the balance could be updated incorrectly if multiple threads
attempted to modify it simultaneously.

Transaction Consistency:
Transaction consistency means that a transaction will only complete if it preserves the database (or shared resource) integrity.
In the bank account example, this includes ensuring that:
    -Withdrawals do not exceed the available balance (ensuring no overdrafts).
    -Deposits and withdrawals are reflected correctly in the account balance after each operation.
The ReentrantLock helps enforce this by controlling access, ensuring that shared state remains consistent even under concurrent access.

Benefits of Using ReentrantLock
1)Fine-Grained Control: Unlike synchronized methods, ReentrantLock provides finer control over locking.
You can lock and unlock at different points in your code, allowing more complex logic.
2)Try-Locking and Timeouts: ReentrantLock provides mechanisms such as try-locking (tryLock()) and timed locking,
allowing threads to attempt to acquire locks without blocking indefinitely, which can be crucial for designing responsive systems.

Conclusion
When working with shared data in a multithreading environment, it is essential to consider thread safety to avoid inconsistent states.
Utilizing ReentrantLock not only ensures atomicity and transaction consistency but also enhances the ability to manage concurrent
operations more effectively. This makes it a suitable choice for complex applications where multiple threads need to read and modify
shared resources safely. Proper locking mechanisms are integral to maintaining the integrity of the application's state, especially in
scenarios like banking applications, inventory systems, and more.
