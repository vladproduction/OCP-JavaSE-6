        1.The class file was deleted or has become inaccessible at runtime.
        2.The class was not included in the classpath when the application started.
        3.The class is found during initialization, but an exception is thrown while initializing a static initializer.

        it when you try to run a program that references a class that isnâ€™t available.*/
