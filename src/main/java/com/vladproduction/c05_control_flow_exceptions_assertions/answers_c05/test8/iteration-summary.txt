Summary of Each Iteration
Before Loop Starts
Initial Value of x: 7
Static Block Execution: x becomes 8.
Iteration Details
First Iteration (y = 0):

Start of Loop:
x++ → x becomes 9.
Switch Statement:
        case 8:: (does not execute, as x is 9)
        case 9:: Executes, s becomes "9 ".
        case 10:: Executes, s becomes "9 10 ". (Then hits break, exits switch)
End of First Iteration:
Value of x: 9
Value of s: "9 10 "
Second Iteration (y = 1):

Start of Loop:
x++ → x becomes 10.
Switch Statement:
        case 8:: (does not execute, as x is 10)
        case 9:: (does not execute, as x is 10)
        case 10:: Executes, s becomes "9 10 10 ". (Then hits break, exits switch)
End of Second Iteration:
Value of x: 10
Value of s: "9 10 10 "
Third Iteration (y = 2):

Start of Loop:
x++ → x becomes 11.
Switch Statement:
        case 8:: (does not execute, as x is 11)
        case 9:: (does not execute, as x is 11)
        case 10:: (does not execute, as x is 11)
default:: Executes, s becomes "9 10 10 d ".
        case 13:: Executes, s becomes "9 10 10 d 13 ".
End of Third Iteration:
Value of x: 11
Value of s: "9 10 10 d 13 "
