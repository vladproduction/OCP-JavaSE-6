 * bad idea to skip encapsulation principle;
 * Look out for code that appears to be asking about the behavior of a
 * method, when the problem is actually a lack of encapsulation.
 *
 * Now consider this question: Is the value of right always going to be one-third the value of left?
 * It looks like it will, until you realize that users of the Foo class
 * donâ€™t need to use the setLeft() method! They can simply go straight to the instance
 * variables and change them to any arbitrary int value.
