Which statement(s) are true? (Choose all that apply.)
 A. Cohesion is the OO principle most closely associated with hiding implementation details
 B. Cohesion is the OO principle most closely associated with making sure that classes know
about other classes only through their APIs
 C. Cohesion is the OO principle most closely associated with making sure that a class is
designed with a single, well-focused purpose
 D. Cohesion is the OO principle most closely associated with allowing a single object to be
seen as having many types

A. This is encapsulation, not cohesion.
Cohesion focuses on a class's internal responsibility, while encapsulation deals with how a class controls access to its data and methods.

B.  This is loose coupling, which is related to cohesion but distinct. Loose coupling aims to minimize dependencies between classes,
while cohesion is about a class's internal focus.

### C. This is TRUE. A highly cohesive class concentrates on a specific, well-defined set of functionalities.

D. This is polymorphism, not cohesion.
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in different ways.
